\me started his work as a doctoral student in February 2016.\parsmall

\headsmall{2016}
\begin{itemize}
  \item planning improvements for the ETH pixel telescope %with Felix Bachmair
  \item setting up the framework for the pad analysis % started by Mario Seeli
  \begin{itemize}
		\item modifying EUDAQ to convert beam test data % from binary to root trees
		\item setting up tracking and alignment software
		\item writing waveform analysis code
  \end{itemize}
  \item performing beam tests at \ac{PSI}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item general investigation of pad, pixel and 3D detectors
    \item rate studies of the diamond detectors at different irradiations\\ up to \SI{2e15}{n\per\centi\meter^2}
  \end{itemize}
  \item assisting with 3D beam tests at CERN
\end{itemize}

\headsmall{2017}
\begin{itemize}
  \item finishing pcb-drawings and start production of the telescope's new version
  \item further developing and improving pad analysis
  \item including pixel and 3D analysis into the framework
  \item conducting further beam tests at \ac{PSI} and CERN
  \begin{itemize}
		\item measuring detectors at irradiations up to \SI{4e15}{n\per\centi\meter^2}
		\item investigation of the reproducibility of the data
  \end{itemize}
  \item start planning and construction of the high resolution telescope
\end{itemize}

\headsmall{2018}
\begin{itemize}
  \item testing the telescope's improved version
  \item testing and installing of the high resolution telescope
  \item conducting further beam tests at \ac{PSI} and CERN
  \begin{itemize}
