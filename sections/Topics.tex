Within the RD42 Collaboration Mr. Reichmann is investigating the behaviour the signal response of planar and 3D \ac{pCVD} diamond detectors in pad or pixel geometries depending on incident particle flux and characterising their internal structure with a high resolution beam telescope. The rate tests are solely performed at \ac{PSI} using the beam line piM1 with a positive \SI{260}{\mega\electronvolt\per c} pion beam and tunable particle fluxes from \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} whereas the high resolution test are performed at CERN using the SPS beam H6 with pions or protons up to momenta of \SI{200}{\giga\electronvolt\per c}.\par
Mr. Reichmann is in charge of organising and conducting the RD42 high rate beam tests at \ac{PSI} assisting also other members of the collaboration performing experiments.
