As a member of the RD42 Collaboration \me is investigating the behaviour the signal response of planar and 3D \ac{pCVD} diamond detectors in pad or pixel geometries depending on incident particle flux. He is also characterising the composition of 3D detectors and the internal structure of the \ac{pCVD} diamond material with a high resolution beam telescope.\parsmall

% HIGH RATE BEAM TEST
The flux studies are performed at \ac{PSI} using the beam line piM1 with a positive \SI{260}{\mega\electronvolt\per c} pion beam and tunable particle fluxes from \SI{1}{\kilo\hertz\per\centi\meter^2} up to \SI{20}{\mega\hertz\per\centi\meter^2}.\par
\me is responsible for the organisation and the execution the RD42 high rate beam tests at \ac{PSI}. This includes the maintenance and further development of the ETH beam telescope and the overall set-up at \ac{PSI}, qualifying the data-taking and improving as well as adapting the \ac{DAQ} framework EUDAQ.\par

% PAD
In order to study the suitability of \ac{pCVD} diamond as a sensor for particle detectors at high rates, the most simple detector geometry - a pad detector - is investigated. The detectors which are metallised with thin layers on both sides, are measured at various fixed rates recording their signals. These waveforms are then analysed to get conclusions about their behaviour at the tested rates.\par

% PIXEL
Since the current technology at the innermost tracking layers of the LHC is based on planar pixel detectors also \ac{pCVD} diamond sensors read out with state of the art \acp{ROC} are investigated. These \acp{ROC} digitise the signals above a tunable threshold already on the chip using an \ac{ADC}. Therefore also the effects of threshold as well as the more complex electric field in the pixel geometry are analysed.\par

% 3D
The 3D detector is a very promising radiation tolerant detector concept. Within RD42 these detectors are built utilising a femtosecond laser to create the readout and bias electrodes. \me is testing the working principal as well as the rate behaviour of these detectors in both pad-like and pixel setup.\parsmall

% HIGH RESOLUTION BEAM TEST
The high resolution tests are performed at CERN using the SPS beam line H6 with charged hadrons of \SI{120}{\giga\electronvolt\per c}.\par
The \ac{pCVD} diamond is a material consisting of many single crystalline cells along the direction of growth which vary in size and shape. This fact also plays an important role for the detectors, especially 3D. Therefore the current ETH telescope is upgraded in order to measure both the inner structure of the material as well as the structure of the various detector geometries and designs with a high spatial resolution.\parend
