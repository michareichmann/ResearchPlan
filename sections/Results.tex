\me is working according to schedule. He has completed the pad analysis framework which extracts the signal size information from the waveforms after applying a set of cuts. This software is also used during the beam tests to evaluate the quality of the data. He is working towards a publication summarising the results which claim that \ac{pCVD} diamond detectors show less than \SI{2}{\%} dependence of the signal on incident particle flux up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per\centi\meter^2}.\par
There is also a positive development in both pixel and 3D analysis. An efficiency above \SI{99}{\%} compared to a planar silicon device can be claimed for a 3D diamond pixel detector with a pixel pitch of \SI{50x50}{\micro\meter}.\par 
The upgrade of the telescope is proceeding as planned too and the mounting frame for the high resolution upgrade is about to be finished. \parend
