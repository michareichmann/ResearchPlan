\head{Results \& Progress}
So far Mr. Reichmann works regarding to his schedule. Until now he has almost finished the pad analysis and is working towards the a paper summarising the results claiming that \ac{pCVD} diamond detectors show less than \SI{2}{\%} dependence of the signal on incident particle flux up to \SI{10}{\mega\hertz\per\centi\meter^2}. There is also good progress in both pixel and 3D analysis. So far an efficiency above \SI{99}{\%} compared to a planer silicon device can be claimed for a 3D diamond pixel detector with a pixel pitch of \SI{50x50}{\micro\meter}. Also the telescope upgrade works well and it's mounting is about to be finished.
